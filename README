Blackhole Chaser
=================================

This is the backend project of the blackhole chaser.
It offers a backend gui which pretty basic in functionality but can be added to the needs of future users.
And it also overs a REST API which can be consumed by everything right now and is consumed by an angular/html project
called frontend.

Run:
./activator ui (see what happens)
./activator run (let it run without gui)
